Driving Rules  
  
Lights - parking lights, high beam, low beam  
Gears

**Stop Sign** -
(1) Slow down and stop behind line
(2) look in all four directions
(3) Go when safe

**Yield Sign** - 
(1) Slow down 
(2) Be ready to stop if there are crossing pedestrians or cars
(3) Do not stop if there are no pedestrians or cross traffic

SMOG = Signal Mirrors Over-The-Shoulder Go
Signal at least 100 feet, unless right after intersection in which case you signal after you cross the intersection
Mirrors look left, top and right one

**Driving Straight**  
Put foot on accelerator  
Keep eyes pointing forward (not down in front) to look 2-3 cars ahead  
Stay in the middle of the lane  
Drive at or 5-10 below speed limit  
Maintain safe following distance of 2-3 seconds  
Keep an eye out for road signs and obstructions  
Keep looking at mirrors every 7-10 seconds for other cars  
  
**Changing Lanes (SMOG)**
Signal in the direction you want to go
Check mirrors
Look over the shoulder for your blind spot
Slow down if necessary
Make sure you leave enough space between you and the car that will be in front of you after the change
Change lanes

**Right Turn**
(1) SMOG Move to the right-most lane. If it's a bike lane, move into it after SMOG so bicyclists don't get hit when you take a right turn
(2) Stop before limit line, cross walk or before the intersection.
(3) Look left-right-left-right. Look for oncoming traffic, pedestrians. Look to your right for pedestrians. Look for start of rightmost lane you'll need to turn to.
(4) Start turning while still looking over shoulders in both directions to make sure you don't collide in either direction.
(5) Right turn has right of way vs traffic turning to the left. If however, the light is yellow or turns red, the car in the intersection taking a left turn has right of way. Stop and allow them to leave the intersection.
(6) When turning right on a red light, all opposing traffic and pedestrians have right of way.

You may cross a bus-lane for a right turn.
Dedicated right turn lane, you can go without stopping even if red, as long as not prohibited by traffic sign or there are pedestrians you need to yield for.


Left Turn
(1) Enter left turn lane. Keep wheels straight.
(2) Figure out where exactly the left-most lane will be after the turn by looking at lane markings. Aim for that lane.
(3) If the turn is unprotected, yield to all oncoming traffic going straight or taking a right. They have right of way. If the light turns red however AND you're in the intersection, you have right of way (because oncoming traffic for straight and right turn have a red now). Turn.
Turn left on red only from one-way street to another one-way street.


Emergency situations -  
Accelerator stuck - put on neutral, use hand brake
