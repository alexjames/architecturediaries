# Authentication
## Definition
Authentication is the process by which a user or application identifies itself to another application or system. Authorization is the validation that they are allowed to perform an action on a resource within the system.
 
Passwords, cryptographic tokens, and biometrics are some of the common ways of authentication.

## Factors in Authentication
Factors are

- Something you know i.e “here is something only you could have known, so it must by you”
  * Password (memorized phrase)
  * PIN (numerical code)
  * Security Questions (“what’s your first pet’s name?”, “where did you go to school?”)
- Something you have i.e “here is something only you could possess, so it must by you”
  * Mobile phone (automated phone call, SMS, authentication apps)
  * Smart card
  * Hardware Tokens
  * Magic Link (URL with embedded tokens)
- Something you are (with biometrics, accuracy and privacy can be a problem)
  * Fingerprint
  * Facial recognition
  * Retinal/Iris Scan
- Something you do i.e. “this is something you do that is unique to you”
  * Voice recognition
  * Handwriting/signature recognition
  * Typing patterns/speed
- Somewhere you are
  * Geolocation
  * IP based
